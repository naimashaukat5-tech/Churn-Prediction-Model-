# Churn-Prediction-Model-
📊 Churn Prediction Model
📌 Project Overview

The Churn Prediction Model helps identify users who are most likely to leave the platform based on their LMS engagement logs. By analyzing behavior such as login frequency and course activity, this project provides insights to design personalized support strategies that improve retention.

🎯 Objective

Analyze user behavior (logins, course engagement, activity patterns).

Predict churn risk using machine learning models.

Support data-driven decisions to reduce churn and boost retention.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python 🐍

Pandas, NumPy → Data preprocessing & analysis

Matplotlib, Seaborn → Data visualization

Scikit-learn → Machine Learning models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)

📂 Dataset

Source: LMS engagement logs (simulated/real data)

Contains:

UserID → Unique user identifier

LoginFrequency → Number of logins per week

CourseEngagement → Time spent on courses
